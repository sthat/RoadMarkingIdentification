# RoadMarkingIdentification
The fourth group of road marking identification, Zhang Hongbo
This member is mainly responsible for the OpenCV technology and algorithm work and camera selection for road edge recognition processing. The image acquisition device was selected as a forward-looking monocular CMOS lens. Firstly, image pre-processing, including grayscale and binarization, is performed to improve image quality and avoid noise interference. Then, the edge detection and contour extraction of the pre-processed images are performed by using the image processing functions in OpenCV to identify the road markings in the images. The recognition algorithm can successfully detect not only conventional solid lines and dashed lines, but also special road markings such as herringbone lines, guide lines and grid lines. By extracting the region of interest (ROI) and non-zero pixel points, the algorithm can process the video and identify the changes of road markings within 6-10 meters in real time. The robustness of the algorithm is good, but the generality needs to be improved. The algorithm is designed and implemented with suitable hardware devices for road edge recognition. The performance of the algorithm was tested and evaluated, and the expected results were achieved.
